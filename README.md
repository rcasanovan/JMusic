# JMusic

JMusic is a library developed in Java (and NetBeans) that allows management to create a mp3 music player.

I created the library for my projects in the area of Algorithms and Programming III at School of Engineering at the AndrÃ©s Bello Catholic University (UCAB) in Caracas, Venezuela.

After years working with the library, I decided to release it as an open source project.

The library is based on JLayer -> http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html.

The goals of this code are:

* Abstracting mp3 player implementation in Java
* Allow people who don't know the implementation of a mp3 player create one in Java very easily
* Allow programming teachers create more interesting and complex projects without the need for implementing a mp3 music player

## Adding JMusic to your project

You need to follow these steps:

* Add the JMusic library JAR file to you project
* Create a JMusicPlayerList list with the mp3 info for each song
* Use the MusicPlayerControl.initMusicPlayer method with mp3 music files path and JLabel that contains the song information
* Use the MusicPlayerControl.loadSongs method with the JMusicPlayerList list
* That's it!

## Optional steps:

Use the following methods (at MusicPlayerControl class) in order to control your music player:

* playAllSongs
* playSong
* pauseSong
* nextSong
* prevSong
* repeatSong
* repeatSongsFromTheBeginning
* resumeSong
* stopSong

## Internal JMusic mp3 music player

If you want it, you can use the internal JMusic mp3 music player. You just need to follow the next steps:

* Create a JMusicPlayerList list with the mp3 info for each song
* Use the JMusicPlayer.main method with mp3 music files path and the JMusicPlayerList list
* Done! :3

## Javadoc

If you need any help with the library methods you can use the javadoc documentation (it's include in the project)
